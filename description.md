Dear Razor support,

I'm sad to inform you guys my Razer Naga has given up on me, it is not recognised on my pc in various usb 2.0 /3.0 ports and on my laptop/brothers pc all with the same result ; 

Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)

A request for the USB device descriptor failed.

I've been an razer costumer for as long as i got into serious gaming starting all the way back in 2013 were i purchased my blackwidow ultimate and an razer naga (1st gen) and that naga also broke about 1,5 years ago... well i thougth that could happen so no problem and bougth a new one (just outside my warrenty).

The lovely razer naga molten edition owww the good times i shared with this little bad boy only to found out it also betrayed me and die on me feelsbad.jpg

This was about 2 months ago and i recieved another razer naga from a friend as borrow because his PC wasn't functioning but as expected now he wants his mouse back.

currently im realy dissapointed in the fact that i've gone trough 2 razer naga's and within 24 hours im without a mouse...

I always use my electronics with great care and that makes the feeling that my 2nd mouse broke down even worse. All the love i had for Razer as a product line (blackwidow, (working) razer naga and my xbox controller i have) but mostly i'm impressed at your marketing/esports influence, huge fan of the League and CSGO CLG team, UOL, you even recently partnered with SKT #hype!

but despice all that my personal experience is realy ... right now

well i hope that we can resolve this and would love to hear soon

Greetings,

Stijn van Kessel
