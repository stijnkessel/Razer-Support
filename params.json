{"name":"Razer-support","tagline":"Description","body":"Dear Razor support,\r\n\r\nI'm sad to inform you guys my Razer Naga has given up on me, it is not recognised on my pc in various usb 2.0 /3.0 ports and on my laptop/brothers pc all with the same result ; \r\n\r\nWindows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)\r\n\r\nA request for the USB device descriptor failed.\r\n\r\nI've been an razer costumer for as long as i got into serious gaming starting all the way back in 2013 were i purchased my blackwidow ultimate and an razer naga (1st gen) and that naga also broke about 1,5 years ago... well i thougth that could happen so no problem and bougth a new one (just outside my warrenty).\r\n\r\nThe lovely razer naga molten edition owww the good times i shared with this little bad boy only to found out it also betrayed me and die on me feelsbad.jpg\r\n\r\nThis was about 2 months ago and i recieved another razer naga from a friend as borrow because his PC wasn't functioning but as expected now he wants his mouse back.\r\n\r\ncurrently im realy dissapointed in the fact that i've gone trough 2 razer naga's and within 24 hours im without a mouse...\r\n\r\nI always use my electronics with great care and that makes the feeling that my 2nd mouse broke down even worse. All the love i had for Razer as a product line (blackwidow, (working) razer naga and my xbox controller i have) but mostly i'm impressed at your marketing/esports influence, huge fan of the League and CSGO CLG team, UOL, you even recently partnered with SKT #hype!\r\n\r\nbut despice all that my personal experience is realy ... right now\r\n\r\nwell i hope that we can resolve this and would love to hear soon\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nStijn van Kessel","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
